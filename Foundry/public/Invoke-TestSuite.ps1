<#
.SYNOPSIS
Invokes the language-specific testing engine for the given project.

.DESCRIPTION
Invokes the language-specific testing engine for the given project.

.PARAMETER Name
The name of the project that will be targeted by this operation.

.EXAMPLE
Invoke-TestSuite ExampleProject

.NOTES
This cmdlet only deals with PowerShell tests (with Pester) at the momemnt. It also does not handle cases where a project uses more than one language. If this becomes an issue
I think it would be doable to evaluate each file and run the correct test suite based on extension.
